                <p>Full-stack software engineer with Nancy Drew-like debugging skills in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.</p>

                <p>After working as a professional actor for 10 years, when the COVID-19 pandemic put my industry at a standstill, 
                I was determined to use this time to find another way to use my brain in a way I hadn't in quite some time. The journey 
                led me to coding, where I fell in love with the dopamine rush of solving a tricky problem. I completed an immersive 
                software engineering bootcamp at the Flatiron School, and am excited to continue my coding journey.</p>

                <p>With my background in the arts, I bring immense creativity, the ability to empathize and take on the perspectives of 
                others, and a laser-sharp focus to the table.</p>

                <p>I am passionate about bettering other peopleâ€™s lives and the world around us through code, and seek to work on projects 
                that align with my values.</p>

                <p>On the weekends I love getting outside in nature and baking delicious treats.</p>
